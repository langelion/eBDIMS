# eBDIMS

**eBDIMS** is a coarse-grained hybrid Elastic Network/Brownian Dynamics
model to generate transition pathways between two functional protein end-states.

An integrated tool to generate eBDIMS pathways is available at [https://login.biophysics.kth.se/eBDIMS](https://login.biophysics.kth.se/eBDIMS).

To fine-tune algorithm parameters, or to use large or incomplete structures, the
stand-alone packages contained within this repository can be used.

## Stand-alone packages
